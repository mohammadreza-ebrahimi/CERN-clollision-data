This repository is included a perfect example for **Machin learning**.

It is about electron mass prediction by utilizing _CERN electron collision data_. 
We examined different model as follows

- LinearRegression
- DecisionTree
- RandomForest

Then, after training model by using them, we examined them
for data which prepared by **Polynomial Feature**.  
At the end, we would train several perfect models with low _cost function_ where the best **RMSE** would be gotten as **1.6** for the test set. 

Still this model can gives us the better **MSE** or **RMSE**
by tuning **Hyperparameter**.  
If you have any question or suggestion please [contact](mailto:m.reza.ebrahimi1995@gmail.com) me.
