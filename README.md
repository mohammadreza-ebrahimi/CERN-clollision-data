## CERN-clollision-data

This repository is included a perfect example for **Machin learning**.

It is about electron mass prediction by utilizing _CERN electron collision data_. 
We examined different model as follows

- LinearRegression
- DecisionTree
- RandomForest

Then, after training model by using them, we examined them
for data which prepared by **Polynomial Feature**
.

Still this model can gives us the better **MSE** or **RMSE**
by tuning **Hyperparameter**.
